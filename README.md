# Enough

##### Solo Final Project for the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp

##### Built on a MERN Stack by [Daniel Tovar](https://danieltovar.io/)

### Purpose

Neuroscience tells us that self-affirmations can help us maintain our self-integrity by telling ourselves what we believe in positive ways. In other words, it can affect our perceived ability to respond and effect outcomes in different situations. In studies, self-affirmations have been shown to decrease stress, help create positive habits during interventions and rehabilitation therapy, and increase GPA in students feeling alienated.

This neuroscientific theory can help people like my mom, who struggles with low self-esteem and negative self-worth. With this in mind, I set to build a tool to help my mom practice self-affirmation from her iPhone or iPad.

### Objective

The concept is simple: the app asks users one question—how are you feeling today?—and depending on the answers, one of two things will happen.

1. If the user is feeing 🙂, the app will prompt them to enter at least one positive affirmation: this could be an achievement they’re proud of, a personal strength they’ve identified, something in their life they’re grateful for, or one of their favorite quotes.

2. If the user is feeling 😐 or 🙁, the app will remind them of a positive affirmation they’ve entered before. They will then have the option to cycle through other affirmations or add new one.

**The Version 1.0 deliverable:** a fully responsive, Heroku-deployed web app built on a full MERN stack.

### Approach

I used an Agile approach to build this deliverable.

- Planning Phase: Define MVP objective and technical requirements.
  - Tools: a white board, friends, and a Github automated kanban board.
  - Task: Created multiple User Stories: New User, Returning User, Mobile User, Desktop User.
  - Task: White boarding: Diagramming the non-relational database and the UI wireframe.
  - Task: Research and evaluate potential tools: What packages and bundles do I need to achieve my MVP?
- Design/Development: Design, construction, and implementation.
  - Tools: GitHub, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, React, Redux.
  - Task: Set up Node Express server.
  - Task: Build out the Mongoose Schema for my MongoDB database.
- Integrate and Test:
  - Tools: Postman, iTerm2, Modern Browsers
  - Task: Test “Functionality N”.
- Demo :
  - Tools: GitHub and Heroku
  - Task: Gather feedback.
  - Task: Integrate feedback and changes
- Version Release
